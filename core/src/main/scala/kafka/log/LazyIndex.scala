/**
  * A wrapper over an `AbstractIndex` instance that provides a mechanism to defer loading (i.e. memory mapping) the
  * underlying index until it is accessed for the first time via the `get` method.
  *
  * This is an important optimization with regards to broker start-up and shutdown time if it has a large number of segments.
  * It prevents illegal accesses to the underlying index after closing the index, which might otherwise lead to memory
  * leaks due to recreation of underlying memory mapped object.
  *
  * Finally, this wrapper ensures that redundant disk accesses and memory mapped operations are avoided upon attempts to
  * delete or rename the file that backs this index.
  *
  * @param loadIndex A function that takes a `File` pointing to an index and returns a loaded `AbstractIndex` instance.
